        You may notice that iteration works a little differently here. Rather than arrays of raw values, we are given <code>Row</code> objects, which can be subscripted with the same expressions we prepared above. This gives us a little more powerful of a mapping to work with and pass around.

        Queries can be used and reused, and can quickly return rows, counts and other aggregate values.
