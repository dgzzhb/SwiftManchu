        <h4>Experiment</h4>
        <p>
            Try plucking a single row by taking advantage of the fact that <code>Statement</code> conforms to the <code>GeneratorType</code> protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also try using the <code>Array</code> initializer to return an array of all rows at once.

    <h3>Transactions &amp; Savepoints</h3>
    <p>
        Using the <code>transaction</code> and <code>savepoint</code> functions, we can run a series of statements, commiting the changes to the database if they all succeed. If a single statement fails, we bail out early and roll back. In the following example we prepare two statements: one to insert a manager into the database, and one—given a manager’s row ID—to insert a managed user into the database.
